#### Description

This is a Qwiic breakout board based on PAJ7620U2. It can recognize 9 human hand gesticulations such as moving up, down, left, right, forward, backward, circle-clockwise, circle-counter clockwise, and waving. 

The normal gesture detecting range is 5 to 15 cm, and the operating view angle is at 60° diagonally. The PAC7620 also offer built-in proximity detection for the purpose of sensing an object approaching or departing.

As it is a [Qwiic compatible](https://www.smart-prototyping.com/Qwiic.html) module, you can use [Qwiic cable](https://www.smart-prototyping.com/zio-cables) to daisy chain it with other Qwiic devices, no need soldering and jumper wire connecting!
